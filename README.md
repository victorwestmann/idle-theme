# idle-theme
This is a backup of my idle-theme **(Obsidian)**. ;-)

# How to use it?
Place this file (config-highlight.def) in the path **<drive>:\Python34\Lib\idlelib** and replace the current file. (overwrite it)

Installation:

1) Ensure IDLE is closed

2) Open your .idlerc file, usually in your home directory

3) Paste in the settings and save

4) Open IDLE, Options -> Configure

5) Under the Highlighting tab, Obsidian should now be a custom theme available in the dropdown list.


# Why should I use this file?
Not to become BLIND. Pyhton's Idle is too bright for daily use.

# Does this work on system xx on version yy?
This was tested solely on Windows 7 64 bit using python3.4.x but it should work on other platforms as well.
